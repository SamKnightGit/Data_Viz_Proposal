    <h1><b>Reunification in the Korean Peninsula</b></h1>
    <p>North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and warlike rhetoric have established it as a threat especially to its neighbour South Korea. However, with recent diplomatic breakthroughs the idea of peace and even reunification on the Korean Peninsula is becoming more mainstream. Reunification would require support by the people of South Korea. This project will identify the sentiments of the South Korean population regarding North Korea and reunification over time</p>
